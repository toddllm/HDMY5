# Building a Voxel Game with HDMY5 Game Builder

This document outlines the step-by-step process of creating a voxel-style game using the HDMY5 Game Builder. We'll gradually build up the game, testing and refining the builder as needed to support the features required for a Minecraft-like voxel game.

## Project Goals

1. Create a 3D voxel game similar to the existing voxel demo
2. Use the HDMY5 Game Builder interface rather than coding directly against the engine
3. Document the process, challenges, and solutions
4. Improve the game builder based on our findings

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Exploration

- [x] Explore the project structure and understand the components
- [x] Run the existing voxel demo to understand the target functionality
- [x] Create a detailed project plan (this document)
- [x] Analyze the game builder interface and document features/limitations
- [x] Analyze the voxel demo and document its components
- [x] Set up a new game project in the builder

### Phase 2: Basic Scene Creation

- [ ] Create a 3D scene in the game builder
- [ ] Add basic terrain (flat ground)
- [ ] Add a player character
- [ ] Implement basic camera controls
- [ ] Test and document the process

### Phase 3: Voxel Terrain Implementation

- [ ] Integrate voxel data structures with the game builder
- [ ] Implement procedural terrain generation
- [ ] Create a chunk management system
- [ ] Add basic block types (dirt, stone, grass)
- [ ] Test and refine the terrain generation

### Phase 4: Player Interaction

- [ ] Implement player movement (WASD controls)
- [ ] Add jumping and gravity
- [ ] Implement block placement and destruction
- [ ] Add collision detection
- [ ] Create a simple inventory system
- [ ] Test and refine player interactions

### Phase 5: Visual Enhancements

- [ ] Improve block textures
- [ ] Add basic lighting
- [ ] Implement a skybox
- [ ] Add particle effects for block destruction
- [ ] Test and refine visuals

### Phase 6: Game Mechanics

- [ ] Add day/night cycle
- [ ] Implement simple crafting system
- [ ] Add basic enemies or NPCs
- [ ] Create simple objectives or goals
- [ ] Test and refine game mechanics

### Phase 7: Polish and Documentation

- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Add sound effects and music
- [ ] Create a user interface (HUD, menus)
- [ ] Document the complete process
- [ ] Create a demo page for the new game

## Detailed Tasks and Progress

- [ ] Test camera functionality

## Implementation Notes

This section will be updated as we progress through the development phases, documenting challenges, solutions, and improvements to the game builder.

### Current Limitations

Based on our analysis, we've identified the following limitations in the game builder for voxel game development:

1. No built-in support for voxel data structures
2. Limited terrain generation capabilities
3. No chunk management system for efficient rendering
4. Limited support for first-person controls
5. No built-in block placement/destruction mechanics

### Builder Improvements

Potential improvements to the game builder:

1. Add support for voxel data structures
2. Implement a chunk management system
3. Add procedural terrain generation tools
4. Improve first-person camera controls
5. Add block interaction mechanics

### Progress Updates

#### March 8, 2023

- Created project plan and analysis documents
- Set up initial voxel game project structure
- Created basic components for the voxel game
- Implemented a simple store for managing voxel game state

## Testing Plan

For each phase, we will:

1. Test individual features as they are implemented
2. Perform integration testing of combined features
3. Document bugs and limitations
4. Implement fixes or workarounds

## Git Workflow

We will follow this git workflow:

1. Create a feature branch for each major task
2. Make small, focused commits with clear messages
3. Test thoroughly before merging
4. Document changes in this plan file
5. Update the plan as needed based on findings
