# GitHub Pages Demo Site Setup Summary

We've successfully set up a GitHub Pages demo site for the HDMY5 Game Builder project. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## 1. Demo Site Structure Creation

We created a complete structure for hosting a demo site on GitHub Pages:

- `/docs` directory as the root for GitHub Pages content
- Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the demo site
- Placeholder sections for Game Builder and Voxel demos
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices

## 2. Documentation

We created detailed documentation to explain the setup process:

- `docs/GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive guide to setting up GitHub Pages using both the web interface and GitHub CLI
- `docs/COLORWORLD_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` - Detailed plan for deploying to colorworld.live using AWS VM

## 3. GitHub Pages Configuration

For the actual GitHub Pages setup, the repository owner should:

1. Go to the repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to the "Pages" section
3. Set the source to the `main` branch and `/docs` folder
4. Save the settings

After completing these steps, the demo site will be available at: https://toddllm.github.io/HDMY5/

## 4. Future Steps

As outlined in the documentation, future steps include:

1. Setting up the custom domain (colorworld.live) once the GitHub Pages site is live
2. Configuring the AWS VM for more interactive demos
3. Implementing continuous deployment for automatic updates
4. Adding actual interactive demos to replace the placeholders

## 5. Local Testing

To test the demo site locally:

```bash
cd docs
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## 6. Site Updates

The demo site can be updated by:

1. Modifying files in the `/docs` directory
2. Committing and pushing changes to GitHub
3. GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild the site

## 7. Custom Domain (Future)

When ready to set up the custom domain:

1. Update DNS records as outlined in the documentation
2. Add a CNAME file to the docs directory
3. Configure the custom domain in GitHub Pages settings

## Conclusion

This demo site provides a solid foundation for showcasing the HDMY5 Game Builder and Voxel Engine. The setup follows GitHub Pages best practices and includes detailed documentation for future maintenance and enhancements.
